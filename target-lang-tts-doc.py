# ElevenLabs multilingual model
# TTS engine + bilingual AI voice map
    # configs: pitch, speech, pauses, volume, etc...

# python machine translation - EasyNMT?
# use dictionary of most common words; use inverse to identify specialist/technical language
    # sparsely translate, label as lang
# translate (some) full sentences below a certain length (basic sentences)

# would rather set up periodic scrape/checks
# two methods:
    # some are very straightforward, with weekly updates...
    # others do not seem to have a set schedule
        # may have to store the latest title as string
        # each scrape iterates through titles, stopping when it reaches the stored on



# LEAST to MOST complicated sources:
# 1) Deloitte - Weekly global economic update
    # 1/week, weds, all html
    # most straightforward and consistent by far
    # https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-06.html
# 2) McKinsey & Company - Featured Insights
    # weekly updates, all html, sorted into categories
        # "explainers", "week in charts", "themes", "lives & legacies"
        # each article labeled - easy to ignore categories that tend to be chart/infographic/link-heavy
    # non-weekly updates - large pdf reports
        # more difficult, more charts, etc...
